# ElevateLabs-task_6
This task involved creating multiple passwords with different complexity levels and testing them using an online password strength checker. Each password was evaluated based on length, use of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. Scores and feedback from the tool were recorded to compare weak, medium, strong, and very strong passwords. The results helped understand how password complexity affects security and which elements significantly increase cracking resistance. Screenshots of all password evaluations and the full results report are included in this repository.
